After download, put the whole folder (SenGen) into the documents folder.
The full path should look like this :
~/documents/SenGen

Change the folder name (after unzipping) to 'SenGen'.

Open terminal, cd to the folder location, and run 'sudo apt install gnustep-gui-runtime', 'chmod +x Interface-root', 'chmod +x Interface-cd', and 'chmod +x generator'. Run 'Interface-root' if you're running it wihtout cd into the directory, and 'Interface-cd' if you did.
