After download, put the whole folder (SenGen) into the documents folder.
The full path should look like this :
~/documents/SenGen

Change the folder name (after unzipping) to 'SenGen'.

Open terminal, cd to the folder location, and run 'chmod +x Interface' and 'chmod +x generator'. Run 'generator', then check in the output. I can't even get it to work in command line currently.
