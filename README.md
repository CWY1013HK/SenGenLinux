# SenGen
A sentence generator I made in a few days with C++ for MacOS X, now slightly altered for it to work on GNU/Linux. If your Linux has text-to-speech installed, feel free to use the original version.

For detailed instructions on downloading the project and other stuff, read the .txt files in the 'Instructions' folder.

For any queries, email colewong1013@outlook.com.
