# SenGen
A sentence generator I made in a few days with C++ for MacOS, now slightly talored for GNU/Linux. Please install 'gnustep-gui-runtime' first. 

For detailed instructions on downloading the project and other stuff, read the .txt files in the 'Instructions' folder.

For any queries, email colewong1013@outlook.com.
